# Cognitive
Project realtive to the course Cognitive Behavioural and Social Data.

Data regard answers to psychological tests.

When constructing a psychological test, we have to take into account the fact that people will try to lie to get "better" results. In particular, in some tests people will try to "fake good" (for example in test regarding job, child custody ecc.) or "fake bad" (for example in test regarding mental disorder for criminals). This is a serious problem, given the importance of the reasons why these tests are carried out. So finding the patterns in which people lie is an important task.
In this project we are going to try address this problem focusing on two points:

1)Find the the most robust model to detect dishonest responders from honest ones.

2)Find a robust method to select the most important questions for detecting malingering people.
